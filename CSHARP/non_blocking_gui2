You can mark method async and put long running task into a task. Don't forget prevent another call while first one is running:

private async void Start_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    var button = (Button)sender;
    button.Enabled = false;
    await Task.Run(() =>
    {
        .. long running task here will not block UI
    });
    button.Enabled = true;
}
